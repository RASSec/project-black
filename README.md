# Project Black

Scope control, scope scanner and progress tracker for easier working on a bug bounty or pentest project

Anatoly Ivanov of [Positive Technologies](https://ptsecurity.com)

## What is this tool for?

The tools encourages more **methodical** work on pentest/bugbounty, tracking the progress and general scans information.

It can launch
* masscan
* nmap
* dirsearch
* amass
* patator

against the scope you work on and store the data in a handy form. Perform useful filtering of the project's data, for instance:

* find me all hosts, which have open ports, but not 80
* find me all hosts, whose ips start with 82.
* find me hosts where dirsearch has found at least 1 file with 200 status code

## Installation

Basic setup via docker-compose will run on any system which has docker and docker-compose dependency

If you don't have docker installed then

### Docker for Ubuntu/Debian

```
sudo apt install docker.io
```

### Tool installation

If you have docker set up, then for Ubuntu/Debian simply

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
git clone https://github.com/c0rvax/project-black
cd project-black
sudo docker-compose up
```

If you see some SQL errors, try stopping docker-compose (Ctrl + C **once** and wait for nice shutdown) and run `docker-compose up`


This might take some time but that's it! Other distros should have very similar guidance.

Now head to http://localhost:5000, enter the credentials. They can be found in https://github.com/c0rvax/project-black/blob/master/config/config_docker.yml under `application`

For a more complex setup or something failed, see the [wiki](https://github.com/c0rvax/project-black/wiki/Set-up).

### Resources notice

None of the docker containers restrict the amount of resources usage, you are on your own here, however, you can change the amount of parallel tasks for each worker separately. See the wiki for [that](https://github.com/c0rvax/project-black/wiki/Tuning#parallel-tasks-inside-worker)

## How to work?

After a setup, create a project and head to the respective page.

![Open project](https://i.imgur.com/pQT19Yt.png)

Now we will follow the basic steps which you can do within the application

### Add scope

Let's say we are assessing hackerone.com and all it's subdomains. Write `hackerone.com` into the `add scope` field and press `Add to scope`

![Scope add](https://i.imgur.com/uZrsBi2.png)

Entrypoint has been added.

There are other ways to add scope, see [wiki](https://github.com/c0rvax/project-black/wiki/Scope)

### Quick note on working

All of the tasks can read parameters from the user, however, lauching with some options won't diplay any new result as it is pretty difficult to parse all possible outputs of a program. So to start, try working duplicating the options from this manual. 

Available options can be found on this [page](https://github.com/c0rvax/project-black/wiki/Supported-options)

### Start amass

Click the blue button `Launch task`.

![Launch task](https://i.imgur.com/jX2cP4K.png)

A popup with parameters will appear. 

![amass options](https://i.imgur.com/f25OKVf.png)

It is recommended to click the `All_top_level_domains` check box and in argv enter `-ip` and click `Fire!` button.

![amass recommended](https://i.imgur.com/UaGkqmu.png)

This would launch `amass -d hackerone.com -ip`. Note that in this case we did not specify any domain. This is beacause the `All_top_level_domains` check box means looking into the scope which is stored in the database. So the program sees that `hackerone.com` was added to the scope and launches `amass` against it.

Upon finishing, the new data is automatically added to scope.

### Start masscan and nmap

Now head to `IPs` tab. Click the already known button `Launch task` and choose `masscan`.

We will launch a quick scan, using the button `Top N ports`. This autocompletes the `argv` parameter. Press `Fire!`

![Masscan launch](https://i.imgur.com/eveBuU5.png)

Results are automatically downloaded from the database.

![Masscan results](https://i.imgur.com/unDdXPB.png)

Now click `Launch task` and choose `nmap only open`. This will find all the open ports which exist in the database and run nmap only against them.

Click `Banner` and `Fire`.

![nmap only open start](https://i.imgur.com/9NmQsVQ.png)

Detected banner will automatically appear

![nmap banners](https://i.imgur.com/TEXmp9u.png)

### Launching dirsearch

Launch dirsearch against all ips and all open ports (both HTTP and HTTPS would be tried)

On `IPs` tab click `Launch task` and select `dirsearch`. Fill in extenstions you want to try and click `Fire!`

You can launch dirseach agains hosts (not ips) on the `Hosts` tab.

#### Note on dirsearch

If there are no ports, dirsearch won't even start. So first, make sure you launched nmap or masscan to discover open ports.

## Inspecting results

There are generally three ways to check the results:

* IPs/Hosts list
* IP/Host details
* Dirsearch list

### IPs and Hosts list

Those are two tabs. They work the same way so we will stop on Hosts.

![Hosts list](https://i.imgur.com/HQefnhu.png)

You can see a list of hosts, their ports and files. Also you can edit a comment for that host.

Important part here is **filtering** box.

![Filtering](https://i.imgur.com/4sxDYlX.png)

You can aggregate different filters using the field shown above. Type the filter you want (there is a helper for that) and press **Shift + Enter**

![Applied filters](https://i.imgur.com/ZdRsSjp.png)

### IP/Host details

You can also view details on a specific host or ip. Press button with the glasses

![Spectacles](https://i.imgur.com/XJCcFJl.png)

There you will see dirsearch result for every open port on that host

### Dirsearch list

`Dirsearch list` button will open a new window showing all found files for every dirsearch which was launched in this project.

## Launching tasks against specific scope

IPs and Hosts `Launch task` are different! The button on IPs page will start against all ips within the current project, meanwhile the button on the Hosts page will launch against hosts.

To launch a task against some hosts, you should

1. Filter the hosts
2. Launch the task

Example:
![Applied filters 2](https://i.imgur.com/ZdRsSjp.png)

Some filters have been applied. If we now launch dirsearch, it will be launched against hosts which correspond to the used filters.
